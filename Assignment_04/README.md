# Assignment 4: Web Proxy

In this assignment, you will develop a Web proxy. When your proxy receives an 
HTTP request for an object from a browser, it generates a new HTTP request for 
the same object and sends it to the origin server. When the proxy receives the 
corresponding HTTP response with the object from the origin server, it creates a new 
HTTP response, including the object, and sends it to the client. 
For this assignment, the Companion Website provides the skeleton code for the 
proxy server. Your job is to complete the code, and then test it by having different 
browsers request Web objects via your proxy.
