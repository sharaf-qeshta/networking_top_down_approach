# Assignment 3: Mail Client

The goal of this programming assignment is to create a simple mail client that sends 
e-mail to any recipient. Your client will need to establish a TCP connection with 
a mail server (e.g., a Google mail server), dialogue with the mail server using the 
SMTP protocol, send an e-mail message to a recipient (e.g., your friend) via the mail 
server, and finally close the TCP connection with the mail server.
For this assignment, the Companion Website provides the skeleton code for 
your client. Your job is to complete the code and test your client by sending e-mail 
to different user accounts. You may also try sending through different servers (for 
example, through a Google mail server and through your university mail server).
